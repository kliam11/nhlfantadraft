# NHL Roto-style League Draft Optimizer

Quick program put together in 3 days for a fantasy hockey league. Requires your roster and the available players in the draft.
Constraints include your team cap space, required min. # of forwards, defense and goalies, and your draft picks by overall #.

Not perfect. Will require some manual cleanup.
